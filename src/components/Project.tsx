                My dad is my biggest influence, encouraging me to explore the
                possibilities of technology and coding. I still remember his
                speech of continuous learning and his fascination and curiosity
                gradually turned into a career path I wanted to follow.

                Today, I specialize in full-stack web development and am
                proficient in a range of technologies. My skills include
                languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and SQL, as well as
                front-end and back-end frameworks.

                One of the most significant aspects of my journey has been the
                development of several major software projects. Most recently, I
                developed Quizme-fy, an AI-powered quiz creation tool that
                automates the process of generating quizzes from PDF student
                notes.

                Iâ€™m currently working at Sportec Solutions as a Technical
                Manager for Video Systems. In this role, I manage technical
                projects related to sports technology, acting as the middle
                point of communication between the broadcast and the VAR team
                and ensuring seamless delivery of data-driven solutions.
